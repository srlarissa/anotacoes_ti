# **"Por que você se interessou pela KIS Solutions?"**

Ever since i started my career in tech, I've worked at the intersection between marketing and technology. And that taught how to bridge the two together. 

At Virtu, I've learned not only how to develop landing pages, but also to analyze the data from them, and use those  insights at Hubspot to build emails workflows.

Additionally, I've always wanted a opportunity to work at a international environment and use english at daily basis. KIS Solutions looks like the perfect fit for that. 

# **"O que você sabe sobre a empresa e o que mais te atraiu?"**

From what I've seen, I can mention two things:

First: I really liked the "Keep It Simple" philosophy, since I really believe that technology must be a means to an end, not the other way around. So, technology should only be used just enough to meet the business needs.

Second: The CDP technology really caught my attention, since its exactly what I used to do at Virtu but on a larger scale. This excites me about the opportunity to learn even more.

# "Por que você quer sair da sua posição atual/Por que saiu da Virtù?"

At the beginning of this year, Virtu underwent a restructuring after being acquired by another company, and unfortunately my team was let go as part of the process.

While it was unexpected, now I'm looking for an opportunity in a role that combines marketing and technology again. KIS would be a perfect fit, since it's not only this type of role, but at a larger scale.

# "Conte sobre sua experiência com CRM e marketing automation"

At Virtu, I worked with Hubspot developing landing pages and email marketing automation for our healthcare product called Tutti Saúde. I also participated in the Hubspot-Wordpress integration. All the data and metadata was sent to Hubspot for our BI team to analyze and turn them into dashboards. 

Before that, as Marketing Director of IN Junior, I worked a lot with google analytics. At that time, we used Google ADS at the landing page, as it was the main lead generation channel. We used analytics to measure if the paid ad was generating more leads and ROI.

I've learned a lot about working with customer data across multiplatform and use it for marketing decisions.

While running google ads, we noticed that our credits were running out quickly and our lead generation wasn't increasing. 

Actually, using google analytics we discovered something interesting that explained this: 

With Google ads, you pay per click when your link is sponsored. Since we were a junior company associated with a federal university and we ran recruitment processes at least twice a year, many students visited the website to learn more about us. 

Through analytics we realized that most of our clicks weren't coming from potential clients... they were coming from students wanting to apply for our recruitment process.
